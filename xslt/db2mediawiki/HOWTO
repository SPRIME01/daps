How to transform Novdoc into Wiki
-----------------------------------------------------------

The stylesheet in this directory transforms Novdoc documents
into Wiki syntax. 

Some notes:
- The transformation is difficult. Although Novdoc is a subset
  of DocBook, it is not always possible to transform DocBook
  documents with these stylesheets into correct Wiki syntax.
  Use it at your own risk!

- The stylesheets contain two modes: The »normale mode« transforms
  each element into a correct Wiki syntax.
  The »enhanced mode« uses Wiki templates. At the moment, they
  don't always work due to nested structures (they need a Mediawiki
  version 1.6.) However with this method is is sometimes easier to
  change the appearance of text, transformed into Wiki templates.
  They are not finished yet.
  The difference between these two modes are: If you want to use
  this text later in an XML environment, it is a bit easier to
  get »high level semantic structures«.

- The stylesheets supports the rootid feature. With this parameter,
  it is possible to use only a part of your document. However, you
  need an id attribute.


To transform Novdoc documents into Wiki syntax do the following:

1. Validate your document. Without validation, the stylesheets
   might not work. 
   
2. Use small parts of your document first.

3. Try it out of your preferred Wiki.
