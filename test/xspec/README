-----------------------------------------------
XSpec -- Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework for XSLT
-----------------------------------------------

This directory contains xspec files for testing our DocBook customization 
layer for HTML and XSL-FO.

1. Contents
-----------------
* htmlbase.xspec
  Contains testcases for single (X)HTML output

* src/, results/
  These directories contains the source DocBook XML files and the
  results from HTML or FO transformation. They are read in by htmlbase.xspec

* build/
  Contains the result of the test run. For example, the result HTML file
  from htmlbase.xspec is htmlbase-result.html

* xspec.sh
  Shell script to run the XSpec framework.


2. Prerequisites
-----------------
In order to run the test, install the xspec package from my OBS repository
(home:thomas-schraitle). Some important things you need to know:

 * XSpec relies on XSLT2. As such, it uses Saxon9
 * HTML is tested against XHTML


3. Running Tests
-----------------
Use the following procedure:

 a. Change the directory where the xspec.sh script is stored
 b. Install the xspec package, if you haven't done so.
 c. Check the environment variable XEP_HOME in xspec.sh
 d. Run the script with a xspec file:
    $ xspec.sh htmlbase.xspec
 e. Check the result in build/htmlbase-result.html
