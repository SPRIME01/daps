  Virtualization is a technology that provides a way for a machine (Host) to
  run another operating system (guest virtual machines) on top of the host
  operating system.

    <para>
   Included with SUSE Linux Enterprise are the latest open-source virtualization
   technologies, Xen and KVM. With these
   <xref linkend="gloss.vt.hypervisor"/>s SUSE Linux Enterprise can be used to provision,
   de-provision, install, monitor and manage multiple virtual machines
   (VM Guests) on a single physical system. Out of the box, SUSE Linux Enterprise can
   create virtual machines running both modified, highly tuned,
   paravirtualized operating systems and fully virtualized unmodified
   operating systems. Full virtualization allows the guest OS to run
   unmodified and requires the presence of either Intel* Virtualization
   Technology (Intel VT) or AMD* Virtualization (AMD-V).
  </para>
    <para>
   The primary component of the operating system that enables virtualization
   is a <xref linkend="gloss.vt.hypervisor"/> (or virtual machine manager),
   which is a layer of software that runs directly on server hardware. It
   controls platform resources, sharing them among multiple VM Guests and
   their operating systems by presenting virtualized hardware interfaces to
   each VM Guest.
  </para>
    <para>
   SUSE Linux Enterprise is an enterprise-class Linux server operating system that offers
   two types of <xref linkend="gloss.vt.hypervisor"/>s: Xen and KVM.
   Both <xref linkend="gloss.vt.hypervisor"/>s support virtualization on
   64-bit x86-based hardware architectures. Both Xen and KVM support
   full virtualization mode. In addition, Xen supports paravirtualized
   mode. SUSE Linux Enterprise with Xen or KVM acts as a virtualization host server
   (<xref linkend="gloss.vt.vhs"/>) that supports VM Guests with its own
   guest operating systems. The SUSE VM Guest architecture consists of a
   <xref linkend="gloss.vt.hypervisor"/> and management components that
   constitute the <xref linkend="gloss.vt.vhs"/>, which runs many
   application-hosting VM Guests.
  </para>
    <para>
   In Xen, the management components run in a privileged VM Guest often
   referred to as <xref linkend="gloss.vt.dom0"/>. In KVM, where the Linux
   kernel acts as the hypervisor, the management components run directly on
   the <xref linkend="gloss.vt.vhs"/>.

    <title>Virtualization Capabilities</title>
    <para>
   Virtualization design provides a large number of capabilities to your
   organization. Virtualization of operating systems is used in many
   different computing areas. For example, it finds its applications in:
  </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
     Server consolidation: Many servers can be replaced by one big physical
     server, so hardware is consolidated, and Guest Operating Systems are
     converted to virtual machine. It provides the ability to run older
     software on new hardware.
    </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
     Isolation: guest operating system can be fully isolated from the Host
     running it. So if the virtual machine is corrupted, the Host system is
     not harmed.

      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
     Migration: A process to move a running virtual machine to another
     physical machine. Live migration is an extended feature that allows
     this move without disconnection of the client or the application.

      <listitem>
        <para>
     Disaster recovery: <xref linkend="gloss.vt.virtualized"/> guests are
     less dependent on the hardware, and the Host server provides snapshot
     features to be able to restore a known running system without any
     corruption.

     Dynamic load balancing: A migration feature that brings a simple way to
     load-balance your service across your infrastructure.

   Virtualization brings a lot of advantages while providing the same

   First, it reduces the cost of your infrastructure. Servers are mainly
   used to provide a service to a customer, and a virtualized operating

      <listitem>
        <para>
     Less power/cooling: Less hardware means you don't need to invest more

     Save space: Your data center space will be saved because you don't need

    <title>Understanding Virtualization Modes</title>
    <para>
   Guest operating systems are hosted on virtual machines in either full
   virtualization (FV) mode or paravirtual (PV) mode. Each virtualization
   mode has advantages and disadvantages.
  </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
     Full virtualization mode lets virtual machines run unmodified operating
     systems, such as Windows* Server 2003, but requires the computer
     running as the VM Host Server to support
     <xref linkend="gloss.vt.hwassisted"/> virtualization technology, such
     as AMD* Virtualization or Intel* Virtualization Technology.
    </para>
        <para>
     Some guest operating systems hosted in full virtualization mode can be
     configured to run the Novell* Virtual Machine Drivers instead of
     drivers originating from the operating system. Running virtual machine
     drivers improves performance dramatically on guest operating systems,
     such as Windows Server 2003. For more information, see
     <xref linkend="app.vmdp.driver" xrefstyle="ChapTitleOnPage"/>.
    </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
     Paravirtual mode does not require the host computer to support
     <xref linkend="gloss.vt.hwassisted"/> virtualization technology, but
     does require the guest operating system to be modified for the
     virtualization environment. Typically, operating systems running in
     paravirtual mode enjoy better performance than those requiring full
     virtualization mode.
