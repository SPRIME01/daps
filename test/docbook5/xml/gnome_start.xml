  GNOME is an easy-to-use graphical interface that can be customized to meet
  your needs and personal preferences. This section describes the default
  configuration of GNOME. If you or your system administrator modifies the
  defaults, some aspect might be different, such as appearance or key
  combinations.

   If more than one user account is configured on your computer, generally
   all users must authenticate—unless <guimenu>Auto Login</guimenu> is
   enabled for a specific user. Auto login lets a user automatically log in
   to the desktop environment when the system starts. This feature can be
   enabled or disabled during installation or at any time using the YaST
   User and Group Management module. For more information, refer to
   <xref linkend="cha.y2.userman"/>. If your computer is running in a
   network environment and you are not the only person using the machine,
   you are usually prompted to enter your user name and password when you

   appears with a panel at the bottom with following elements:

      Clicking <guimenu>Activities Overview</guimenu> in the bottom part of
      the <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> menu takes you to the so-called
      Activities overview where you start programs and manage those already
      running. You also reach this view by placing the mouse pointer in the
      top left corner of the screen or pressing the
      <guimenu>Windows</guimenu> key (also called the
      <guimenu>Super</guimenu> key). You return to the normal view by

    Activities overview is a special mode that dedicates a full screen to
    all the different ways in which the user can switch from doing one thing
    (an activity) to doing something else. It shows previews of all the

        <title>Using the Activities Overview</title>
        <para>
     The activities overview contains three important parts:
    </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>
       On the left, there is a favorite bar. It contains favorite
       applications as well as the running applications with open windows.
       If you hover over one of the icons with the mouse pointer, GNOME will
       tell you the name of the pertaining application. A light glow
       indicates that the application is running and (at least) one window
       is open. Right-clicking an icon opens a small menu which offers
       different actions depending on the associated program. With Add to
       Favorites, you can place the application icon permanently in Dash. To
       remove a program icon from Dash, select Remove from Favorites. If you
       want to rearrange an icon in the dock, hold the left mouse button
       pressed above it and then drag it to its new position.
      </para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
       On the top, there is a search box. If you cannot find what you are
       looking for or when things need to get done quickly, the small search
       box on the top will help. As soon as you enter a term there, GNOME
       will show all the matching applications and system settings. By the
       way, you do not need to clickthe search box first, you can begin
       typing directly.

          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>
       On the right, there is an overview of active virtal desktops. Click

    To start a program, you have several options:

    Click <guimenu>Applications</guimenu> in the bottom panel and choose the
    desired program from the hierarchical menu.

   </para>

    You can also start the program using the activities view. You can reach
    this view by placing the mouse pointer in the top left corner of the
    screen or pressing the <guimenu>Windows</guimenu> key (also called the
    <guimenu>Super</guimenu> key). Now you have two options. Either click
    the program icon in the bar on the left edge of the screen, or enter a
    term into the search box in the upper part of the activities view. You
    can use the name of the desired program or try any meaningful keywords,
    such as <literal>image</literal> or <literal>photo</literal> in the case
    you need an image editor.
