  This chapter introduces and explains the components and technologies you
  need to understand to set up and manage a Xen-based virtualization
  environment.

    <title>Basic Components</title>
    <para>
   The basic components of a Xen-based virtualization environment are the
   <emphasis>Xen hypervisor</emphasis>, the <emphasis>Dom0</emphasis>,
   any number of other <emphasis>VM Guests</emphasis>, and the tools,
   commands, and configuration files that let you manage virtualization.
   Collectively, the physical computer running all these components is
   referred to as a <emphasis>VM Host Server</emphasis> because together these
   components form a platform for hosting virtual machines.

          <para>
      The Xen hypervisor, sometimes referred to generically as a virtual
      machine monitor, is an open-source software program that coordinates
      the low-level interaction between virtual machines and physical
      hardware.

   The following graphic depicts a virtual machine host with four virtual
   machines. The Xen hypervisor is shown as running directly on the
   physical hardware platform. Note that the controlling domain is also a
   virtual machine, although it has several additional management tasks
   compared to all the other virtual machines.

  <para>
   After you install the virtualization components and reboot the computer,
   the &grub; boot loader menu displays a &xen; menu option. Selecting the
   &xen; menu option loads the &xen; hypervisor and starts the &dom0;
   running the &suselinux; operating system.
  </para>

  <para>
   Running on &dom0;, the &suselinux; operating system displays the
   installed text console or desktop environment, such as GNOME. The
   terminals of &vmguest; systems are displayed in their own window inside
   the controlling &dom0; when opened.
