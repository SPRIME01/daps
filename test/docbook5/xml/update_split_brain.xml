  <title>The Atomic Update</title>
  <para>
  The Atomic Update is based on tools that manage two copies of the system
  and allow easy recovery after an update failure. The delivered tools
  require a special disk partition setup. Every copy of the system resides
  on a primary partition of its own. If an update fails, you can always
  switch back to the previous state of the system, which is available on the
  other partition.

      <title>Strict Partitioning Requirements</title>
      <para>
    The implementation has strict requirements on disk partitioning: the
    first root partition is <filename>/dev/sda1</filename> and must not
    occupy more than half of the entire disk size. Then the tools will
    create <filename>/dev/sda2</filename> for the system's second root
    partition. Further partitions if available are shared on both root
    partitions—take their size into account, and reduce the size of
    the first partition accordingly; this is a rough calculation:
   </para>
      <para>
    The size of the complete disk minus size of
    <systemitem>sda1</systemitem> minus <systemitem>sda2</systemitem> is the
    free space of additional partitions.
   </para>

     Install the system with <filename>/dev/sda1</filename> as the single

        <para>
