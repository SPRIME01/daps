   for each project, but the questions to answer should include the
   following:

    <title>Deployment of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</title>
    <para>
   To make sure that your system will run flawlessly, always try to use
   certified hardware. The hardware certification process is an ongoing
   process and the database of certified hardware is updated regularly. Find
   the search form for certified hardware at

   Depending on the number of desired installations, it is beneficial to use
   installation servers or even completely automatic installations. Have a
   look at <xref linkend="cha.deployment"/> for more information. When using
   Xen virtualization technologies, network root file systems or network
   storage solutions like iSCSI should be considered.

    <para>
   SUSE Linux Enterprise Server provides you with a broad variety of services. Find an overview of
   the documentation in this book in <xref linkend="pre.sle"/>. Most of
   the needed configurations can be made with YaST, the SUSE
   configuration utility. In addition, many manual configurations are
   described in the corresponding chapters.
  </para>
    <para>
   In addition to the plain software installation, you should consider
   training the end users of the systems as well as help desk staff.

    <title>Running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</title>
    <para>
   The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server operating system is a well-tested and stable system.
   Unfortunately, this does not prevent hardware failures or other causes
   for downtime or data loss. For any serious computing task where data loss
   could occur, a regular backup should be done.
  </para>
    <para>
   For optimal security and data safety, you should make regular updates of
   all the operated machines. If you have a mission critical server, you
   should run a second identical (pre-production) machine where you can
   apply all changes for testing purposes before doing so in production.
   This also gives you the possibility of switching machines in the case of
   hardware failure.
