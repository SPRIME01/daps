  <title>Setting Up Virtual Machines</title>
  <para>
  A virtual machine is comprised of data and operating system files that
  define the virtual environment. Virtual machines are hosted and controlled
  by the VM Host Server. This section provides generalized instructions for
  installing virtual machines.
 </para>
  <para>
  Virtual machines have few if any requirements above those required to run
  the operating system. If the operating system has not been optimized for
  the virtual machine host environment, the unmodified OS can run only on
  <xref linkend="gloss.vt.hwassisted"/> virtualization computer hardware, in
  full virtualization mode, and requires specific device drivers to be
  loaded. The hardware that is presented to the VM Guest depends on the
  configuration of the host.

  You should be aware of any licensing issues related to running a single
  licensed copy of an operating system on multiple virtual machines. Consult
  the operating system license agreement for more information.

    <title>Virtual Machine Architectures</title>
    <para>
   The virtual machine host runs only on AMD64 and Intel 64 hardware. It
   does not run on other system architectures such as POWER. A 64-bit
   virtual machine host can, however, run both 32-bit and 64-bit operating
   system.
<!-- 2011-09-15 toba: the following is not true since SP2:
   , while a 32-bit host cannot run a 64-bit client. This holds true
   for both, the controlling domain and all further guests. --></para>

     If you are installing a paravirtual machine's operating system from CD

    <para>
     If you are installing a paravirtual machine's operating system from CD,
     you should remove the virtual CD reader from the virtual machine after
     completing the installation, because the virtual machine assumes that
     the original CD is still in the CD reader, even if it is ejected. If it
     is ejected, the virtual machine cannot access the CD (or any other
     newly inserted CD) and receives I/O errors.

     <title>Changing CD-Roms</title>
     <para>
      On paravirtual guests, it is currently not possible to go on with the
      installation of a system after changing the CD-Rom. Instead, you
      should use a DVD or a network based installation. For a workaround to
      this problem, see <xref linkend="sec.xen.config.vcd.para"/>.

     If the installation program is capable of recognizing an installation
     profile, response file, or script, you can automate the installation
     settings by specifying the location of the profile, response file, or
     script you want to use. For example, SUSE Linux uses an AutoYaST profile,
     NetWare uses a NetWare Response File, and Red Hat uses a Kickstart file
     to move through the installation screens with no interaction.

   When booting the system, append an extra root option to the kernel
   command line, that tells the system about its root file system. If your
   &vmguest; used to live on <filename>/dev/hda2</filename>, append the
   string <literal>root=/dev/xvda2</literal> to the kernel command line.
   This option should enable you to boot the system, although additional
   file systems still will not be available to the system.

      The software I/O translation buffer allocates a large chunk of low
      memory early in the bootstrap process. If the requests for memory
      exceed the size of the buffer it usually results in a hung boot
      process. To check if this is the case, switch to console 10 and check
      the output there for a message similar to
     </para>

      to find the optimal size for the machine.
