  With the <command>zypper</command> command line utility you can upgrade to
  the next version of the distribution. Most importantly, you can initiate
  the system upgrade process from within the running system.

  This feature is attractive for advanced users who want to run remote
  upgrades or upgrades on many similarly configured systems.

     Disable third party repositories before starting the upgrade, or lower
     the priority of these repositories to make sure packages from the
     default system repositories will get preference. Enable them again
     after the upgrade and edit their version string to match the version
     number of the distribution of the upgraded now running system.

      <title>Check Your System Backup</title>
      <para>
    Before actually starting the upgrade procedure, check that your system
    backup is up-to-date and restorable. This is especially important
    because you must enter many of the following steps manually.
   </para>
    </warning>
    <para>
   The program <command>zypper</command> supports long and short command
   names. For example, you can abbreviate <command>zypper install</command>
   as <command>zypper in</command>. In the following text, the short
   variants are used.
  </para>
    <procedure>
      <step>
        <para>
     Run the online update to make sure the software management stack is
     up-to-date. For more information, see

        <para>
     Configure the repositories you want to use as an update source. Getting
     this right is essential. Either use YaST (see
     <xref linkend="sec.y2.sw.instsource"/>) or <command>zypper</command>
     (see <xref linkend="sec.zypper"/>).

     The name of the repositories as used in the following steps could vary
     a little bit depending on your customizations.

     To view your current repositories enter:

          <step>
            <para>
       Increase the version number of the system repositories from 11-SP2 to
       11-SP3; add the new repositories with commands such as:
      </para>
            <screen>server=<replaceable>http://download.example.org</replaceable>
zypper ar $server/distribution/11-SP3/repo/oss/ SLE-11-SP3
zypper ar $server/update/11-SP3/ SLE-11-SP3-Update</screen>
            <para>
       And remove the old repositories:
      </para>
            <screen>zypper rr <replaceable>SLE-11-SP2</replaceable>
zypper rr <replaceable>SLE-11-Update</replaceable></screen>

          <step>
            <para>
       Disable third party repositories or other openSUSE Build Server repositories, because
       <command>zypper dup</command> is guaranteed to work with the default
       repositories only (replace <replaceable>repo-alias</replaceable> with
       the name of the repository you want to disable):
      </para>
            <screen>zypper mr -d <replaceable>repo-alias</replaceable></screen>
            <para>
       Alternatively, you can lower the priority of these repositories.

              <title>Handling of Unresolved Dependencies</title>
              <para><command>zypper dup</command> will remove all packages having
        unresolved dependencies, but it keeps packages of disabled
        repositories as long as their dependencies are satisfied.
       </para>
            </note>
            <para><command>zypper dup</command> ensures that all installed packages
       come from one of the available repositories. It does not consider the
       version, architecture, or vendor of the installed packages; thus it
       emulates a fresh installation. Packages that are no longer available
       in the repositories are considered orphaned. Such packages get
       uninstalled if their dependencies can not be satisfied. If they can
       be satisfied, such packages stay installed.
