  It is not possible to ship a distribution that is optimized for all
  workloads. Different workloads vary substantially in some aspects. Most
  important among those are I/O access patterns, memory access patterns, and
  process scheduling. A behavior that perfectly suits a certain workload
  might reduce performance of another workload. For example, I/O-intensive
  tasks, such as handling database requests, usually have completely
  different requirements than CPU-intensive tasks, such as video encoding.
  The versatility of Linux makes it possible to configure your system in a
  way that it brings out the best in each usage scenario.

  This manual introduces you to means to monitor and analyze your system. It
  describes methods to manage system resources and to tune your system. This
  guide does <emphasis>not</emphasis> offer recipes for special scenarios,
  because each server has got its own different demands. It rather enables
  you to thoroughly analyze your servers and make the most out of them.

     The Linux kernel itself offers means to examine every nut, bolt and
     screw of the system. This part introduces you to SystemTap, a scripting
     language for writing kernel modules that can be used to analyze and
     filter data. Collect debugging information and find bottlenecks by
     using kernel probes. Last, monitor applications with the help of
     Oprofile.

     The Linux kernel can be optimized either by using sysctl or via the
     <filename>/proc</filename> file system. This part covers tuning the I/O
     performance and optimizing the way how Linux schedules processes. It
     also describes basic principles of memory management and shows how
     memory management could be fine-tuned to suit needs of specific
     applications and usage patterns. Furthermore, it describes how to
     optimize network performance.
