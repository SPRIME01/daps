Docmanager

Docmanager is a tool for managing your XML files (preferrebly with daps). 
It uses and creates SVN properties to get an overview of all your files.

The most important property is "doc:status"; it tracks the status of a
file. A initial state of a file is "editing". After it has been edited
it is changed to the "edited" state. A proofreader can search for all
edited files and sets these file list to state "proofing". After the
proofing has been finished, it is set to "proofed". Whenever something
is wrong with the file, a proofreader can track that with the "comments"
state.
