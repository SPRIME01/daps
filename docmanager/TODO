TODO 
-----------------------------------------------------------


- Align filenames correctly
  => Done

- Add a --sort option which sorts the corresponding column
  For example, --sort name would sort the name column
  alphabetically, whereas --sort priority it sorts it
  nummerically

- Add "merged" state? (from tbazant)

- Sorting is complicated with the '__' output. This was
  used to find modified states for content and properties.
  Idea: use content change/prop change as separate columns
  instead of 'M ' for example.
  (from Frank)
