This project contains the following parts:

DTD
  The Novdoc DTD is used as an exchange format between Novell
  and SUSE. It is very similar to DocBook, although some elements
  are missing. The Novdoc DTD should be compatible to DocBook

XSLT Stylesheets
  There are customized version of the DocBook XSLT stylesheets
  that are used for HTML and FO. The customized part represents
  the Novell look and feel in HTML and PDF.
  At the moment the FO stylesheets works with XEP (RenderX) only.

Makefiles
  Some files for make which use the DTD and the XSLT stylesheets.

Helper Scripts
  Used to prepare this circus. :) Or make life easier.
