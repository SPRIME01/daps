README for "exclude-files_for_daps_package"

Since the aformentioned file itself does not allow comments, some information
on why particular files are included or excluded is collected here:

+ bin/trunkcopy.sh: only relevant for managing the SVN repository

+ contrib/: collection of files that are not necessary to use DAPS

+ daps-xslt/common/colornames.txt: is only the companion file to colornames.xml
   which DAPS actually uses

+ deprecated/: collection of files which are outdated and may be deleted
   soon

+ devel/: collection of files which are outdated and may be deleted
   soon

+ doc/presentation/: conference presentations about DAPS that are nto strictly
   DAPS documentation

+ docmanager/: is its own package ("daps-docmanager")

+ etc/fop/fop-daps.xml: is a template for a user configuration file that does
   not need to be shipped with the DAPS package

+ fonts/*.sfd: Fontforge sources for some modified fonts that are currently
   shipped with DAPS (all of which may actually better be suited to be shipped
   with suse-xsl-stylesheets)

+ packaging/: files that are needed for packaging, some of which are shipped
   inside the DAPS package, but need to be placed outside the TAR archive

+ project-web/*: the http://daps.sf.net homepage

+ suse/: is its own package ("suse-xsl-stylesheets"), BUT we need the suse2013
   and daps2013 subfolders to be able to easily build the DAPS documentation

+ test/: test cases that are made to be run from the SVN repository

+ .svn/: SVN repository information

+ *.~/*~: temporary files
