daps for Debian
---------------

The Ubuntu/Debian package contains a daps.links file. The upstream project of xmlstarlet produces a binary file /usr/bin/xml. The Ubuntu packagers of that package has renamed that binary to /usr/bin/xmlstarlet. Because of the daps sourcecode uses the /usr/bin/xml binary i have added the links file. So we have a softlink now from /usr/bin/xmlstarlet to /usr/bin/xml. If the bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xmlstarlet/+bug/1378861 is solved we can delete the daps.links file.
