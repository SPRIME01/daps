FO Stylesheet Bugs
==================

Status: * = NEW, W = WONTFIX, F = FIXED, L = Later, I = IRREPRODUCIBLE
Priority: P1 (very important) ... P5 (nice to have)

#1  F P1  Remove ugly line at the top of pages
#2  F P1  Either find better serif font or adapt size, so x-height/ascenders
          better match Open Sans/DejaVu Sans Mono â€“ no luck thus far among open
          fonts
#3  * P1  Re: "verbatim" areas: Find out why FOP tries to hyphenate after many
          " " or "-" characters, no matter where they are on the line (See e.g.
          "Example 5.3.  Pretty-printed Output ..." in the DAPS User Guide);
          DcBk-FO parameter hyphenate.verbatim.characters might be relevant.
#4  * P1  Set various things in monospaced font, like commands and keycaps
#5  * P2  TOC: Make sure entire line is a link, not just the page number
#6  * P1  Make sure all titles are set in &sans; (Examples/Figures, in TOC,
          etc.)
#7  * P3  <refentry>s don't get linked to from the TOC
