FO Stylesheet Bugs
==================

Status: * = NEW, W = WONTFIX, F = FIXED, L = Later, I = IRREPRODUCIBLE
Priority: P1 (very important) ... P5 (nice to have)

#1  F P1  Remove ugly line at the top of pages
#2  F P1  Either find better serif font or adapt size, so x-height/ascenders
          better match Open Sans/DejaVu Sans Mono – no luck thus far among open
          fonts
#3  * P1  Re: "verbatim" areas: Find out why FOP tries to hyphenate after many
          " " or "-" characters, no matter where they are on the line (See e.g.
          "Example 5.3.  Pretty-printed Output ..." in the DAPS User Guide);
          DcBk-FO parameter hyphenate.verbatim.characters might be relevant.
#4  F P1  Set various things in monospaced font, like commands and keycaps
#5  * P2  TOC: Make sure entire line is a link, not just the page number
#6  * P1  Make sure all titles are set in &sans; (Examples/Figures, in TOC,
          etc.)
#7  * P3  <refentry>s don't get linked to from the TOC
#8  * P3  Find out what's behind <l:gentext> keys like "fop1.body.font.family"
          etc.
#9  * P2  Remove hyphenation in titles (ragged right text should rather not be
          hyphenated)
#10 F P1  <keycap function="..."> does not work—should add text Alt, Ctrl, etc.
#11 * P1  Too many pages of GFDL...
#12 F P1  <replacement>s don't get the right font size in body text
#13 * P1  TOC is not listed in the PDF bookmarks
#14 * P2  TOC is pretty heavy-weight (see also mockup for parts)
#15 * P2  request for refnamediv title (see component.xsl's split.title)
          (HA guide)
