FO Stylesheet Bugs
==================

Status: * = NEW, W = WONTFIX, F = FIXED, L = Later, I = IRREPRODUCIBLE
Priority: P1 (very important) ... P5 (nice to have)

#1  F P1  Remove ugly line at the top of pages
#2  * P1  Either find better serif font or adapt size, so x-height/ascenders
          better match Open Sans/DejaVu Sans Mono â€“ no luck thus far among open
          fonts
#3  * P1  Re: "verbatim" areas: Find out why FOP tries to hyphenate after many
          single " " or "-", no matter where they are on the line (See e.g.
          "Example 5.3.  Pretty-printed Output ..." in the DAPS User Guide);
          DcBk-FO parameter hyphenate.verbatim.characters might be relevant.
