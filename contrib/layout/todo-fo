FO Stylesheet Bugs
==================

Status: * = NEW, W = WONTFIX, F = FIXED, L = Later, I = IRREPRODUCIBLE
Priority: P1 (very important) ... P5 (nice to have)

#3  * P1  Re: "verbatim" areas: Find out why FOP tries to hyphenate after many
          " " or "-" characters, no matter where they are on the line (See e.g.
          "Example 5.3.  Pretty-printed Output ..." in the DAPS User Guide);
          DcBk-FO parameter hyphenate.verbatim.characters might be relevant.
          (see: http://sourceforge.net/p/daps/tickets/135/ )
#5  * P2  TOC: Make sure entire line is a link, not just the page number
#7  * P3  <refentry>s don't get linked to from the TOC
#8  * P3  Find out what's behind <l:gentext> keys like "fop1.body.font.family"
          etc.
#9  I P2  Remove hyphenation in titles (ragged right text should rather not be
          hyphenated)
#13 * P1  TOC is not listed in the PDF bookmarks
#14 * P2  TOC is pretty heavy-weight (see also mockup for parts)
#15 * P2  request for refnamediv title (see component.xsl's split.title)
          (HA guide)
#16 * P2  Figure out all of Fop's odd font-not-found-substituting errors
          (Open Sans, normal, 600 most certainly exists, e.g.)
#17 * P4  Links on callouts should refer to the beginning of the line the
          callout is on, not to the exact position of the callout (less
          scrolling to the left necessary)
#18 * P3  formalpara: weird distance between title and para... do we want that?
#19 * P2  Make sure a page break occurs whenever a sect{1,2} occurs after 3/4s
          of the length of a page (somehow, talk to Tom...)
#20 * P2  Legal texts in articles are usually wrapped in a sect1 instead of a in
          an appendix – need to find a way to apply the page master there
#21 * P4  Deeply nested admonitions (see docs_to_test) look terrible – leaving
          out the icon in that case would improve the situation, however, the
          correct element for that case would seem to be a fo:block instead of
          a fo:list (the case we have in docs_to_test is tip/variablelist/
          warning/itemizedlist/table/admonition, though something similar may
          happen if admonitions are nested in multi-column tables)
#23 I P2  Tables with screens in them seem to contain unnecessary space at the
          bottom
#24 * P1  Style headlines of examples etc. (make sure distances are right)
#26 * P1  See-alsos don't look like links (maybe they don't need to, but italic
          text seems in order)
#29 * P4  Try to avoid breaks within e.g. parameters (--\ pretty, etc.)
#30 * P3  Some text comes out wrong when selecting it inside the PDF (not sure
          if we can do anything about that) (unsure when exactly it happens –
          italic, uppercase monospace?)
#31 * P4  Find a way to filter out initial spaces before, e.g. from before
          nicely indented paras
#32 * P5  Rather esoteric: we don't support links or cross-references in titles
          while the original DocBook styles support it (it doesn't necessarily
          look favourable though) – this is also not a regression v/ Tom's older
          efforts
#33 * P1  Book/Article/Set title pages should likely get a different style than
          Part title pages
#34 * P2  It is not always clear what belongs to an example and what does not –
          maybe examples should look the same as procedures?
#35 * P2  GFDL numbering broken (2 → F.2, etc.) – these use bridgeheads rendered
          as sect1's in lieu of sect2's – more of a structural problem
#36 * P3  Mark end of parts (or beginning of next structural item?) – rule? dot?
#39 * P4  Localise draft image (use up to 10 characters from gentext:"Draft" for
          the current language) (draft page masters currently use fo-external-
          image; to realise this idea, I would need to be able to use an
          instream-foreign-object; so this would necessitate replacing every
          single draft master page, doing it upstream might be the only sane
          option – so not doing this for now)
#40 * P1  Adapt table layout
#42 * P3  Investigate better hyphenation with FOP, as described in bnc#817793
