XHTML Stylesheet Bugs 
=====================

Status: * = NEW, W = WONTFIX, F = FIXED, L = Later, I = IRREPRODUCIBLE
Priority: P1 (very important) ... P5 (nice to have)

#8  * P5 Glossary/Definition of Terms: think about contextual explanations
         (tooltips..?)
#17 * P4 Frank: Gather image widths directly from images, write it (+2px) into
         framing div.figure => saxon + DB Extensions(?)
#18 * P4 Tom: div.procedure > ol.procedure is unnecessarily complicated:
         div.procedure > ol more useful
#25 * P3 Test with IE (partly done, more could be helpful)
#31 * P2 Tom: Embed fonts (Open Sans, Droid Sans Mono) via <link> directly from
         HTML, optimize for languages (only add Cyrillic/Greek if necessary)
#44 * P5 Implement search (from GSoC project)
#50 * P2 Tom: kill valign
#53 * P3 Tom/Stefan: add special class for headlines directly following each
         other
#64 * P3 Tom/Stefan: let license texts (GFDL) have smaller font size than
         other content (foldable?) → role="legal" should add a class in XHTML
#78 * P4 Find a good way to host fonts on SUSE servers
#79 F P2 Breadcrumbs: modify highest level/second highest level (as discussed)
#80 * P2 Adapt new stylesheet to OpenSUSE (exchange logo) and DAPS (blue/brown)
#82 * P5 Load languages/formats into picker from external file (iframe/json?)
         (iframe will likely lead to bubbles that are too tall/too small, 
         whereas json would mean that we could adapt the height, but might
         overall be more complicated)
#86 * P4 Check HTML output for localized XML sources (check languages
         besides EN-US) (Note: Hungarian might be tricky, as "Procedure
         1.5" becomes "1.5 Procedure")
#90 * P2 Tom: <refentry>s don't get a title. That would be useful, though.
#94 * P3 Callouts in cha.new.bash.html#sec.new.bash.start slightly too far to
         the right – can regulate that via margins but that would result in them
         looking wrong elsewhere
#102* P4 Very weird layout bug of print/share buttons in Firefox (DAPS® Review
         and Translation) – happens on all pages that are very short, sometimes
         happens intermittently when browser was just opened)
#104* P2 Chrome/Safari do not like smooth scrolling yet
#108F P2 In Single-HTML/article: Link to index page in breadcrumbs does not much
         sense make
#117* P3 Too much text per line (135 characters v/ ~60–80 recommendation)
#122* P2 Let SUSE logo link to something
#125F P2 Create Smartphone Layout/Behaviour (mostly fixed, high PPI devices
         notwithstanding)
#127F P2 Include another (deeper) level in ToC's (first page)
#130* P3 In TOC: More distance needed between different level-1 items, if a
         second level exists (SLES deployment)
#139* P2 Switch to Roman/alphabetic numbering in lower levels (ol.orderedlists)
#140F P1 Another occurrence of the two books (SLES-admin book)
#141* P3 Improve subtitle appearance
#142* P2 Improve bubble deactivation
#143* P2 It is not always clear what belongs to an example and what does not –
         maybe examples should look the same as procedures?
