Webseitenbugs
=============

Status: * = NEW, W = WONTFIX, F = FIXED, L = Later, I = IRREPRODUCIBLE
Priority: P1 (very important) ... P5 (nice to have)

#8  * P5 Glossary/Definiion of Terms: think about contextual explanations
         (tooltips..?)
#16 * P2 Tom: Remove style="list-style-type: bullet/disc;" from DocBook template
#17 * P1 Frank: Gather image widths directly from images, write it (+2px) into
         framing div.figure => saxon + DB Extensions(?)
#18 * P4 Tom: div.procedure > ol.procedure is unnecessarily complicated:
         div.procedure > ol more useful
#25 * P3 Test with IE
#26 * P1 Implement arrows for architectures
#28 * P4 Find out why Epiphany doesn't like Droid Sans Mono Bold
#31 * P2 Tom: Embed fonts (Open Sans, Droid Sans Mono) via <link> directly from
         HTML, optimize for languages (only add Cyrillic/Greek if necessary)
#43 * P4 Organize z indices
#44 * P1 Implement search (from GSoC project)
#45 * P4 Mark external links (add arrow ↑)
#50 * P2 Tom: kill valign!!!!!
#51 * P2 Hide pickers if JS is not activated/documentation is packaged
#52 * P2 Tom/Stefan: Show deactivated back/forward button on first/last page
         (glow, stripes?)
#53 * P3 Tom/Stefan: add special class for headlines directly following each
         other
#55 * P1 div.line after first headline (around .page-toc) (glossary-Template?)
#56 * P2 Add back/forward buttons to the end of the page (as on de.selfhtml.org)
#59 F P1 Tom: .list-of-{$titles}s are not split into .name/.number (lots)
#64 * P3 Tom/Stefan: let license texts (GFDL) have smaller font size than
         other content (foldable?) → role="legal" should add a class in XHTML
#66 * P1 Tom: inconsistent outline numbers (depends on whether they are
         contained in headlines or in TOCs)
#71 * -- Breadcrumbs: less than useful "›" on the highest level
#73 F P1 Title of Glossaries is book title even if another title is set
#74 * P3 div.line after first headline (around .page-toc) (article-Template?)
#75 * P1 Implement bubble TOC
#76 * -- Remove tables, div.mediaobjects from figures/informalfigures
#77 F P1 Remove bubble/scrolling bug
#78 * -- Find a good way to host fonts on SUSE servers
#79 * -- Breadcrumbs: decide what the highest level should be
#80 * P5 Adapt new stylesheet to OpenSUSE (exchange logo) and DAPS (blue/brown)
#81 * P1 Decide how article pages should differ from books and sets (it's
         likely beneficial if articles and sets use largely the same set of
         controls, i.e. no TOC bubble, no Navigation)
#82 * -- Load languages/formats into picker from external file (iframe/json?)
         (iframe will likely lead to bubbles that are too tall/too small, 
         whereas json would mean, we could adapt the height)
#83 * P? Stefan: Raise margin-top in list-of-{$title}s and in normal toc for
         chapters, appendices, preface, and glossaries
