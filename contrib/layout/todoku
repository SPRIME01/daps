Webseitenbugs
=============

Status: * = NEW, W = WONTFIX, F = FIXED, L = Later, I = IRREPRODUCIBLE
Priority: P1 (very important) ... P5 (nice to have)

#8  * P5 Glossary/Definition of Terms: think about contextual explanations
         (tooltips..?)
#17 * P1 Frank: Gather image widths directly from images, write it (+2px) into
         framing div.figure => saxon + DB Extensions(?)
#18 * P4 Tom: div.procedure > ol.procedure is unnecessarily complicated:
         div.procedure > ol more useful
#25 * P3 Test with IE (partly done, more could be helpful)
#26 * P1 Implement arrows for architectures
#28 * P4 Find out why Epiphany doesn't like Droid Sans Mono Bold
#31 * P2 Tom: Embed fonts (Open Sans, Droid Sans Mono) via <link> directly from
         HTML, optimize for languages (only add Cyrillic/Greek if necessary)
#43 * P4 Organize z indices
#44 * P1 Implement search (from GSoC project)
#50 * P2 Tom: kill valign!!!!!
#52 * P2 Tom/Stefan: Show deactivated back/forward button on first/last page
         (glow, stripes?)
#53 * P3 Tom/Stefan: add special class for headlines directly following each
         other
#64 * P3 Tom/Stefan: let license texts (GFDL) have smaller font size than
         other content (foldable?) → role="legal" should add a class in XHTML
#66 F P1 Tom: inconsistent outline numbers (depends on whether they are
         contained in headlines or in TOCs)
#71 * P1 Breadcrumbs: less than useful "›" on the highest level
#74 * P3 div.line after first headline (around .page-toc) (article-Template?)
#75 * P1 Implement bubble TOC
#76 * P3 Remove tables, div.mediaobjects from figures/informalfigures
#78 * P4 Find a good way to host fonts on SUSE servers
#79 * P2 #nbg-discuss Breadcrumbs: decide what the highest level should be
#80 * P5 Adapt new stylesheet to OpenSUSE (exchange logo) and DAPS (blue/brown)
#81 * P1 #nbg-discuss Decide how article pages should differ from books and sets
         (it's likely beneficial if articles and sets use largely the same set
         of controls, i.e. no TOC bubble, no Navigation)
#82 * P3 Load languages/formats into picker from external file (iframe/json?)
         (iframe will likely lead to bubbles that are too tall/too small, 
         whereas json would mean that we could adapt the height, but might
         overall be more complicated)
#84 * P1 Don't generate bubble TOC for articles as that adds quite a bit
         of overhead
#86 * P4 Check HTML output for localized XML sources (check languages
         besides EN-US) (Note: Hungarian might be tricky, as "Procedure
         1.5" becomes "1.5 Procedure")
#90 * P2 Tom: <refentry>s don't get a title. That would be useful, though.
#92 * P2 Stefan: Rewrite JS to J-Query which should make it shorter and safer
#93 * P2 nbg-discuss Tom: Don't generate TOCs for parts any more, as they tended
         to confuse in user testing
         Problem: part toc can be easily suppressed (generate.toc, see revision
         2152). However, it turns out, the page is almost useless as it doesn't
         provide any information to the reader.
         Solutions:
         1. Remove part titlepage altogether. Needs heavy(?) customizations in
            chunking templates [Another problem is that people have been linking
            to these pages in the past – while we might be able to redirect to
            the first chapter of the set that might not be the most intuitive
            solution.]
         2. Show chapter abstracts, similar to set titlepage
#94 * P3 Callouts in cha.new.bash.html#sec.new.bash.start slightly too far to
         the right
#95 * P1 Tom: Still some outline inconsistency (superfluous dots in the Bubble
         TOC and forward/back buttons)
#96 * P1 Tom: Many books don't know where they begin and end any more (judging
         by the ←/→ navigation buttons on the top (we even have links leading
         to 404 if a book (that has a set above it) is built without the set
         being built).
#97 * P1 HA-all contains some *very* odd version names/numbers. See e.g.
         SLE-ha-all/art_ha_quick_nfs.html
