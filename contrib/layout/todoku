Webseitenbugs
=============

Status: * = NEW, W = WONTFIX, F = FIXED, L = Later, I = IRREPRODUCIBLE
Priority: P1 (very important) ... P5 (nice to have)

#8  * P5 Glossary/Definition of Terms: think about contextual explanations
         (tooltips..?)
#17 * P1 Frank: Gather image widths directly from images, write it (+2px) into
         framing div.figure => saxon + DB Extensions(?)
#18 * P4 Tom: div.procedure > ol.procedure is unnecessarily complicated:
         div.procedure > ol more useful
#25 * P3 Test with IE (partly done, more could be helpful)
#26 * P2 Implement arrows for architectures
#28 W P4 Find out why Epiphany doesn't like Droid Sans Mono Bold – there is no
         such thing as Droid Sans Mono Bold, it is therefore automatically
         emboldened and never looks good
#31 * P2 Tom: Embed fonts (Open Sans, Droid Sans Mono) via <link> directly from
         HTML, optimize for languages (only add Cyrillic/Greek if necessary)
#43 F P4 Organize z indices
#44 * P5 Implement search (from GSoC project)
#50 * P2 Tom: kill valign!!!!!
#53 * P3 Tom/Stefan: add special class for headlines directly following each
         other
#64 * P3 Tom/Stefan: let license texts (GFDL) have smaller font size than
         other content (foldable?) → role="legal" should add a class in XHTML
#74 * P3 div.line after first headline (around .page-toc) (article-Template?)
#76 F P3 Remove tables, div.mediaobjects from figures/informalfigures
#78 * P4 Find a good way to host fonts on SUSE servers
#79 * P2 Breadcrumbs: modify highest level/second highest level (as discussed)
#80 * P5 Adapt new stylesheet to OpenSUSE (exchange logo) and DAPS (blue/brown)
#81 * P1 Make single articles look like (upcoming) single HTML 
#82 * P5 Load languages/formats into picker from external file (iframe/json?)
         (iframe will likely lead to bubbles that are too tall/too small, 
         whereas json would mean that we could adapt the height, but might
         overall be more complicated)
#84 * P1 Don't generate bubble TOC for articles as that adds quite a bit
         of overhead
#86 * P4 Check HTML output for localized XML sources (check languages
         besides EN-US) (Note: Hungarian might be tricky, as "Procedure
         1.5" becomes "1.5 Procedure")
#90 * P2 Tom: <refentry>s don't get a title. That would be useful, though.
#93 F P2 On part pages, show chapter abstracts, similar to set titlepages
#94 * P3 Callouts in cha.new.bash.html#sec.new.bash.start slightly too far to
         the right – can regulate that via margins but that would result in them
         looking wrong elsewhere
#95 * P1 Tom: Still some outline inconsistency (superfluous dots in the Bubble
         TOC and forward/back buttons)
#96 F P1 Tom: Many books don't know where they begin and end any more (judging
         by the ←/→ navigation buttons on the top (we even have links leading
         to 404 if a book (that has a set above it) is built without the set
         being built).
#97 * P1 HA-all gets some *very* odd version names/numbers. See e.g.
         SLE-ha-all/art_ha_quick_nfs.html
#98 * P1 Do 1-HTML
#99 * P1 Chrome does not like how images are linked (probably matters only
         locally)
#100F P1 Chrome does not like my yellow backgrounds for :target + ... + ...
#101* P1 Some key parts of the chunked pages are not yet translatable (toolbar)
#102* P4 Very weird layout bug of print/share buttons in Firefox (DAPS® Review
         and Translation) – happens on all pages that are very short
#103F P2 Impossible to mark glossary definitions – better rethink <a id>
         structure and favour giving the elements themselves IDs (pos:rel;
         top:-x;padd-top:x;mar-bot:-x; x=30px)
#104* P2 Chrome does not like smooth scrolling yet
