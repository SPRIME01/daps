Closed FO Stylesheet Bugs
=========================

#1  F P1  Remove ugly line at the top of pages
#2  F P1  Either find better serif font or adapt size, so x-height/ascenders
          better match Open Sans/DejaVu Sans Mono – no luck thus far among open
          fonts
#4  F P1  Set various things in monospaced font, like commands and keycaps
#6  F P1  Make sure all titles are set in &sans; (Examples/Figures, in TOC,
          etc.)
#10 F P1  <keycap function="..."> does not work—should add text Alt, Ctrl, etc.
#11 F P1  Too many pages of GFDL... (fixed for books, partly fixed for articles)
#12 F P1  <replacement>s don't get the right font size in body text
#22 F P2  Use bigger bullets in lists
#25 F P1  Unnamed/simple links don't get arrow symbol
#27 F P2  Extend monospace font size adjustment to monospace inside links/xrefs
#28 F P1  Glossary/appendix/preface, etc. style should match chapter style
#37 F P2  Text in tables should not be justified
#38 F P1  Make new layout b/w compatible – c/f daps#137
#41 F P1  Blank draft page master "does not exist"
#43 F P1  Can't seem to check for $format.print with Saxon? My bug! Not Magic's.
