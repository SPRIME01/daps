daps

* documentation

* switching between stylesheet sets / allow custom stylesheets

* generate man pages via ENVfile and daps instead of calling a stylesheet
  directly (daps makefile)

* some targets such as clean do not need an ENVfile to be specified
  do not check for an ENVfile with these targets 

* full or realtive path to ENV-file instead of --basedir

* replace turn on only switches -cdr with turn on/off switches

* auto-generating $MAIN?

* auto detect $MAIN?

* TAB completion for options and subcommands

* check epubs with epubcheck

* generate spec files with daps via spec file template and book specific
