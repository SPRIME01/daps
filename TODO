                              TODO
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

General:

* Documentation!

* Allow custom stylesheets

* Reduce debug messages of make and stylesheets (daps -d now allows
  to have extensive debug output by using (re)make's built-in debugging
  switch)

* rename package, script

-------------
daps

* generate man pages via ENVfile and daps instead of calling a stylesheet
  directly

* some targets such as clean do not need an ENVfile to be specified
  do not check for an ENVfile with these targets 

* full or realtive path to ENV-file instead of --basedir

* add project-init function

* replace turn on only switches -cdr with turn on/off switches

* auto-generating $MAIN

* auto detect $MAIN?

-------------
DocManager

* adjust to new daps version

* shortcut aliases from daps-aliases should be directly integrated into dm

* improve speed by
  - reducing the svn calls to a minimum
  - using python svn bindings

* Make DocManager a subpackage of daps?

-------------
Scripts

* man page and new name for grepimage.sh 

* update, man page and new name for trunkcopy.sh

-------------
Makefiles:

* check if obb.mk, variables.mk, help.mk are needed

* Create flow charts of Makefile mechanic [2011-04-06, fs]

* Restrict graphics generation to graphics needed for the current build
  (rather than generating all images)

* Restrict profiling to current set (rather than profiling xml/*.xml)

-------------
Stylesheets:

* Print all existing IDs (after the headline/text) in draft mode 

* Improve fop support

* Revamp stylesheets and remove any obsolete code pieces

* Improve automatic indexranges so it doesn't create problems during profiling

* FUTURE: Consider XSLT 2.0 and derive it from there

* Quick Starts:
  - Add metadata information into Quick Starts as well
    (mainly doc:status and doc:maintainer) [taroth 2010-12-22]

* Fix bugs from Bugzilla

-------------
Documentation:

* needs to be updated

-------------
Additional Subcommands

* daps init:
  Create the structure and all necessary files for an ambitious author with just this
  subcommand. :)
  Implementation idea/details:
  1. Create the structure with all the files in SVN. That way it can be versioned and
     every change can be tracked
  2. Create an archive from the structure with "svn export"
  3. During packaging, save the archive from the export somewhere in daps system dir
  4. Whenever a user calls "daps init", the archive is extracted to the current dir
    (or to a different dir)
  5. Modify the extracted files afterwards, if neccessary. For example, in our
     XML files could be the title coded as "@TITLE@". The post-processing step could
     replace that with the users' command line option.
