  DocBook Authoring and Publishing Suite (daps) Developement README.devel
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file is mainly interesting for developers who want to hack/work with
the development version of daps.

In order to run daps from this working copy, remember the following things:

1. Do NOT run ./configure if you intend to run daps from this working copy.

2. If you have run the configure script already, run "svn st" to see any
   modified files and roll them back with "svn revert".

3. If you want to run daps from this working copy, *always* add the --dapsroot
   option. To simplify this, define a ddaps function (or alias) which can
   look like this (replace the content of the "D" variable with your absolute
   path of your working copy):

----------[ ~/.bashrc ]----------
ddaps () 
{ 
    echo "****** DAPS Developer Version ******"
    D="/local/doc/daps"
    $D/bin/daps --dapsroot "$D" $@
}
---------------------------------

   If you like, you can also add the --styleroot option.
   Add these lines to your ~/.bashrc (or ~/.bashrc.local) Bash config file.
   

----------
Changing automake files

- the only automake files that may be edited are
  * configure.ac
  * Makefile.am
  Do NOT edit any other automake files, since they are generated.
- Whenever configure.ac or Makefile.am have been changed, you MUST run
  autogen.sh and submit the resulting changes together with your edits

   
----------
Creating New DAPS Version

In order to create a new daps version, do the following:

1. Adapt version number in configure.ac
2. Run autogen.sh
3. Adapt version number in packaging/daps.spec
4. Commit your changes
5. Change to the OBS working copy from Documentation:Tools
   and run daps-fetch-source to get the latest changes from SVN.
6. Run osc vc and add your change log
7. Rebuild the package, fix any errors, and commit to OBS.



Happy Hacking! :)
