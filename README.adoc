            DocBook Authoring and Publishing Suite (daps) README 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project contains the following parts:

daps
  Command to generate various output formats from your XML sources.

docmanager
  Command to manage, editing, and publishing workflow for your documents.

DTD
  The Novdoc DTD - a subset of the original DocBook4 DTD containing
  less elements. It is 100% compatible to DocBook4.
  Using the Novdoc DTD is optional - daps also works with DocBook
  sources.

XSLT Stylesheets
  Customized versions of the DocBook XSLT stylesheets for HTML, FO, and
  other output formats.
  At the moment the FO stylesheets are optimized for XEP (RenderX), but
  also work for fop.

Makefiles
  The makefiles provide methods to generate output formats from XML sources.
  These methods are called from the daps command.

Helper Scripts
  Useful stuff to make authoring and managing your XML and image sources
  easier.
