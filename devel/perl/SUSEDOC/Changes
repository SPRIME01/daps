	Made new() more flexible. The way Frank likes it.

0.07    jw, Fri Jun 18 11:10:57 CEST 2010
	improved project_files(): now honors ROOTID, 
	shows ENV files, and the first entity-decl.
	FIXME: Recursion into entitydecls does not work, as
	 Expat never calls its ExternEnt handler, nor parses
	 entity files when given manually.
