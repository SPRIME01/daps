     <para>&dapsacr; is a lean solution that does not require a lot of system 
    resources. The disk space consumed mostly depends on the amount of your 
    documentation sources and the number of output formats you want to generate.
    If you have multiple or very large documentation projects, a
    machine with multiple-cores is recommended, but is not required.
