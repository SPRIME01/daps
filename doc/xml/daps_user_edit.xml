  <para>As &dapsacr; does not include any editor software, you are 
  completely free in the choice of your XML editor. Basically, you can use
  any text editor, but it is helpful if the editor also supports editing XML 
  in accordance with the DTD you use. A number of open source editors can be 
  extended with plug-ins for automatic tag insertion and completion, insertion
  of <sgmltag>xref</sgmltag> elements or XML attributes and to check if the XML 
  document is well-formed. Popular choices are vi, Emacs or jEdit. </para>
